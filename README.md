## day4Homework from Kodlama.io (2022) Software Developer Bootcamp by [Engin DEMİROĞ](https://github.com/engindemirog) - Java

1. We want to write a project where we bring candidates' coding skills together with employers.
2. Project name: Kodlama.io.Devs

---

* Let's start with a simple requirement.
> Req 1: Programming languages should be kept in the system.

---

* Write codes that can add, delete, update, list, and fetch programming languages (C#, Java, Python). Make it completely in memory.
* Names cannot be repeated.
* Programming language cannot be left blank. (Solve algorithmically by writing code without using validation)

** Important : Never copy paste. Since you will create the project from scratch, it will take time, but it will allow you to reinforce the subject. **
