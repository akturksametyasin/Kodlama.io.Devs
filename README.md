## day4Homework from Kodlama.io (2022) Software Developer Bootcamp by [Engin DEMİROĞ](https://github.com/engindemirog) - Java

* We want to write a project where we bring candidates' coding skills together with employers.
* Project name: Kodlama.io.Devs

---

* Let's start with a simple requirement.
> * Req 1: Programming languages should be kept in the system.

> * Req 2 : Sub-technologies of programming languages should be able to be added, deleted, updated, listed to the system.\
  For example; 
  - Java: Spring, JSP\
  - C#: WPF, ASP.NET\
  - JavaScript : Vue, React

---

1. Write codes that can add, delete, update, list, and fetch programming languages (C#, Java, Python). Make it completely in memory.
2. Names cannot be repeated.
3. Programming language cannot be left blank. (Solve algorithmically by writing code without using validation)

** Important : Never copy paste. Since you will create the project from scratch, it will take time, but it will allow you to reinforce the subject. **
